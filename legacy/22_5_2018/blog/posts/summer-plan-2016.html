<h2 id="summer-plan">Summer Plan for 2016</h2>

<p>Hi! I have not written a blog post for a long time(a very long time indeed).</p>

<p>Now, I’m just writing this blog post about what I’ve planned to do this summer. Most of them are things which I’ve to learn. So here are the things I plan to do this summer:</p>

<h3 id="1-how-to-use-disqus">1. How to use <em>Disqus</em></h3>

<p>Yeah! I’m gonna learn how to use the disqus platform to integrate a comments feature on my blog. It includes using those scripts provided by Disqus. I hope it will be easy to integrate for dynamic websites, especially like this blog, which is built on top of Angular.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I just did it! It was quite easy(But I hope I did it correctly).</p>



<h3 id="2-learn-webrtc">2. Learn WebRTC</h3>

<p>This one’s important. Learning WebRTC with some libraries will enable me to build web-based real-time video chat applications.</p>



<h3 id="3-make-more-gigs">3. Make more gigs</h3>

<p>Make some more gigs on Fiverr.</p>



<h3 id="4-project-management">4. Project Management</h3>

<p>I’m doing a Project Management course on edX <br>

<h3 id="5-learn-spanish">5. Learn Spanish</h3>

<p>Just because I like it. I’ve already started learning it. I’m using Duolingo, some YouTube videos and a free course on edX. Duolingo says, as of now, I’m 15% fluent in Spanish.</p>

<p>I think that would be all for now!</p>
