<h3>Set a video as Desktop wallpaper!</h3>
Setting a video as your desktop wallpaper is easy.You may think that it is impossible as there is no option for setting a video file as the wallpaper, but now I should tell you that it is possible.<br>
A normal image doesn't takes that much memory as a video will take if you set it as your wallpaper, that is why Microsoft never allowed us to do this, because they think that its all about performance not about appearance.<br>
<br>
OK so all&nbsp;the ingredients you need&nbsp;are listed below:<br>
<br>
<b>1)</b> VLC media player<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, that's all.With VLC media player you can set the video, as wallpaper, that is currently being played&nbsp;.VLC thoughts are different from Microsoft.The major difference between them is that they don't charge any money for their products like Microsoft does.It sound pretty good, but it has some defects.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The procedure is as&nbsp;below.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
OK, now you are done with it.<br>
<br>
<h3>
DEFECTS:</h3>
As I mentioned earlier that this technique has some defects, so here they are.<br>
<br>
<b>1)</b> This technique is not supported by Windows Aero, so as soon as you click on&nbsp;'Set as Wallpaper' Windows Aero will be disabled and you colour scheme will be automatically set to Windows 7 Basic.Don't worry about it, nothing will go wrong.Windows Aero will start when the video has stopped playing or VLC is closed.<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<b>2)</b> The video will not remain your wallpaper for ever, it will be disabled as soon as the Video has stopped playing or VLC is closed.<br>
<br>
Well there is another way you can make your background a video, and that is using DreamScene.Here is the <a href="http://digitaldymension.blogspot.no/2013/07/how-to-activate-dreamscene.html" target="_blank">How-to tutorial</a> on it.<br>
