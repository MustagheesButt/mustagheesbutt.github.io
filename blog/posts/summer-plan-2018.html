<h1 id="summer-plan-2018">Summer Plan 2018</h1>

<p>It’s been a year or two since I last wrote a blog post. Although the last summer plan (2016) wasn’t quite successful, I have come a long way since then. The only things I accomplished from the last summer plan were: integrating <em>Disqus</em> in a website, made and sold some gigs on Fiverr, and learnt a little Spanish.</p>

<p>Now I rarely get time for learning stuff since I have enrolled in a 4 year CS degree program at PUCIT (Punjab University College Of Information Technology). To me, it mostly seems a wastage of time. Nevertheless, I got to meet some great people there.</p>

<p>So here’s what I have planned (mostly learning stuff) for this summer.</p>

<h2 id="game-development">1. Game Development</h2>
<p>Harvard University’s CS50 has started another course, called GD50 (Game Development 50), taught by CS50’s own Colton Ogden. It uses the LOVE2D framework and the Lua programming language in it’s first half to teach basic game development concepts such as <em>delta time</em>, <em>game loop</em>, <em>game states</em>, etc. In the second half it uses Unity3D to demonstrate some modern game development.</p>

<p>The course seems promising just like CS50. I have already started it, and intend to finish it before the vacations end.</p>

<h2 id="machine-learning">2. Machine Learning</h2>
<p>Stanford has started a machine learning course (available from 23<sup>rd</sup> July) on Coursera. The hype is real. A friend of mine recommended it me, and he is already about to finish it.</p>

<p>I too wish to start and complete it.</p>

<h2 id="nodejs">3. NodeJS</h2>
<p>NodeJS is quite popular these days. Another friend of mine is using Node to build chatbots on the Messenger platform, which is really cool. But that’s not the only reason I’m interested in it.</p>
<p>There are a lot of cool web applications built using Node, and that’s the primary reason I want to master it. I started learning Node some time ago, but dropped it since I did not find any use for it.</p>

<h2 id="renovate-portfolio">4. Renovate Portfolio</h2>
<p>My portfolio is outdated. I have acquired new skills and gained some more experience, but didn’t keep my portfolio updated. Now, I have planned a complete redesign with updated content.</p>

<h2 id="some-books-i-want-to-finish">5. Some Books I Want to Finish</h2>
<p>Other then that, there are some books I want to finish that I have started, but didn’t get the time to read:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Snowball by <em>Warren E. Buffet</em></li>
	<li>Outwitting the Devil by <em>Napolean Hill</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>I guess I will hardly be able to finish Snowball because of all the other stuff I have gotten myself into.</p>
